    "answer": "To register as a Professional Engineer (PE), you need to meet certain requirements. According to the guidelines, a \"Professional Engineer\" means a person who holds an accredited engineering qualification and after obtaining a professional experience of five years, has passed the prescribed engineering practice examination and is registered as such by the Council. \n\nThere are two categories to apply for the title of Professional Engineer (PE): \nCategory-I: A Registered engineer (RE), who has qualified EPE exam \nCategory-II: An “RE” or an “Engineering graduate, not yet registered with PEC”, but graduated on or before January 15. \n\nThat's what I found in the guidelines, hope it helps!",

It does mention the registration process for International Professional Engineer (Pak) under IPEA, which involves online submission of the application, scrutiny, verification, and assessment of CPD points. \n\nFor Professional Engineer (PE) registration, it seems you need to have an accredited engineering qualification, 5 years of professional experience, and pass the prescribed engineering practice examination. You can check the \"Guidelines for PE\" for more information, but the exact application process isn't clear from the given context. \n\nIf you're looking for a specific type of registration, like RE or PE, I can tell you that there are guidelines available, such as \"Guidelines for RE\" and \"Guidelines for PE\", but the general application process for a PEC number isn't explicitly stated. I don't have that specific information in the uploaded PEC documents.",
